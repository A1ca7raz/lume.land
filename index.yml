  title: A simple & elegant static site generator for Deno
  description: |
    Lume is the [Galician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician_language) word for fire but also a (yet another) static site generator for Deno.

    It’s inspired by other general-purpose static site generators, such as Jekyll and Eleventy, but it’s more flexible and easier to use and configure.

install:
  title: "Run the following to install:"
  code: deno run -A https://deno.land/x/lume/install.ts
  footer: Make sure [you have Deno installed](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation).

usage:
  - title: Supports any template engine
    description: |
      Markdown, Nunjucks, Liquid, JSX, TSX, Javascript, Typescript, Pug, Eta… and it's really easy to add more.
    code: |
      <lume-code>

      ```html { title="Nunjucks" }
      <h1>{{ title }}</h1>

      <ul>
        {% for person in people %}
        <li>{{ person.name }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
      </ul>
      ```
      ```jsx { title="JSX" }
      <h1>{ title }</h1>

      <ul>
        { people.map((person) => <li>{ person.name }</li>)}
      </ul>
      ```

      </lume-code>

  - title: Store the data in your favorite format
    description: |
      JSON, YAML, Javascript & Typescript modules, you name it.
    code: |
      <lume-code>

      ```yaml { title="YAML" }
      title: The team
      people:
        - name: Laura Rubio
        - name: Óscar Otero
      ```
      ```json { title="JSON" }
      {
        "title": "The team",
        "people": [
          { "name": "Laura Rubio" },
          { "name": "Óscar Otero" }
        ]
      }
      ```

      </lume-code>
  
  - title: Process HTML pages and assets
    description: |
      Run processors to compile and optimize assets like PostCSS, Parcel CSS, SASS, Terser, esbuild, SVGO… You can also transform HTML code using the DOM API.
    code: |
      <lume-code>

      ```js { title="Process CSS" }
      site.process([".css"], (file) => {
        const content = file.content;
        file.content = minify(content);
      })
      ```

      </lume-code>

  - title: Run your scripts and listen events
    description: |
      You can create custom scripts like in NPM and execute them when you like.
    code: |
      <lume-code>

      ```js { title="Script creation" }
      site.script("deploy", "rsync -r _site/ user@host.com:/site");
      ```

      </lume-code>

  - title: And everything with a clean and intuitive API
    description: |
      Configure everything in a single _config.ts or _config.js file with plugins and a simple and clean API.
    code: |
      <lume-code>

      ```ts { title="_config.ts" }
      import lume from "lume/mod.ts";
      import postcss from "lume/plugins/postcss.ts";
      import esbuild from "lume/plugins/postcss.ts";

      const site = lume();

      site.copy("./statics", ".")
        .use(postcss())
        .use(esbuild());

      export site;
      ```

      </lume-code>
