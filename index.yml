  title: A simple & elegant static site generator for Deno
  description: |
    Lume is the [Galician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician_language) word for fire but also a (yet another) static site generator for Deno.

    It’s inspired by other general-purpose static site generators, such as Jekyll and Eleventy, but it’s more flexible and easier to use and configure.

install:
  title: "Run the following to install:"
  code: deno run -A https://deno.land/x/lume/install.ts
  footer: Make sure you have Deno installed.

usage:
  - title: Supports any template engine
    description: |
      Markdown, Nunjucks, Liquid, JSX, TSX, Javascript, Typescript, Pug, Eta… and it's really easy to add more.

  - title: Store the data in your favorite format
    description: |
      JSON, YAML, Javascript & Typescript modules, you name it.
  
  - title: Process HTML pages and assets
    description: |
      Run processors to compile and optimize assets like PostCSS, Parcel CSS, SASS, Terser, esbuild, SVGO… You can also transform HTML code using the DOM API.
  
  - title: Run your scripts and listen events
    description: |
      You can create custom scripts like in NPM and execute them when you like.
  
  - title: And everything with a clean and intuitive API
    description: |
      Configure everything in a single _config.ts or _config.js file with plugins and a simple and clean API.

points:
  title: Less magic, more freedom
  features:
    - title: It's Deno!
      description: Forget about managing thousands of packages in node_modules or complex bundlers. Lume only installs what you need. Clean, fast and secure.

    - title: Zero runtime overhead
      description: Some SSG ships their own client javascript to load and hydrate pages.

    - title: Deploy anywhere
      description: Build your site in any CI like Github/Gitlab Pages, Deno deploy, Vercel, Netflify… and host it anywhere.

    - title: Easy to extend
