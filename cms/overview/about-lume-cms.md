LumeCMS is a Deno native CMS to easily manage the content of static sites.
Despite its name, it can be used not only for Lume sites, but also for any other
static site generator like Eleventy, Hugo, Jekyll, etc.

- It supports `yaml`, `json` or any format with front matter like `markdown`.
  It's easy to add more formats.
- In addition to the filesystem, it can store data using other storage methods,
  like Deno KV, or external APIs like GitHub API.
- It allows to live-preview the site.
- It's possible to manage different versions using git branches (work in
  progress).
